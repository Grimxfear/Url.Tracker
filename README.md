# The main purpose of this repository is to create in advance a place to put my finished senior project so that after I graduate I can build it into something even larger in the hopes of garnering attention. It also serves as a project that others may find intersesting and want to contribute whoch would make it easier to roll out updates if theres people contributing vs Me single handedly working on it on top of having a job. Attached is the License I plan on using although it may be subject to change in the future. As of right now I do not feel comftorable publishing my work but as soon as it reaches taht point it will be hosted here. To download the software symply downloadit locally to your computer and then running it in developer mode. After that select load unpacked and select the downloaded file after that extension should be ready for use. Stay tuned for more updates.
