# The main purpose of this repository is to create in advance a place to put my finished senior project so that after I #graduate I can build it into something even larger in the hopes of garnering attention. It also serves as a project that #others may find intersesting and want to contribute whoch would make it easier to roll out updates if theres people #contributing vs Me single handedly working on it on top of having a job. Attached is the License I plan on using although #it may be subject to change in the future. As of right now I do not feel comftorable publishing my work but as soon as it #reaches taht point it will be hosted here. Stay tuned for more updates.
